This dwarven product consists of no more than water, sugar and Element X, whatever that may be. Element X is a morally bankrupt factor in that it is, one: the reason for the dwarves to sell sugar water for preposterous prices even though it adds no taste, and two: early results indicate it may actually cause a variety of diseases.

	<content contentuid="h1ab4b756gf86cg4b53gad46ga5c5e403463a">Commander, the Seven truly are happy residents in your empire, but we could see them happier still! Indulgences make the church rich and powerful, and branding newcomers with the Sign of the Seven separates those really meant for greatness and those who aren&apos;t. Yet, don&apos;t you think the naysayers are let off a bit easily? They are sent to mine and mill to be certain, but they are not actually punished for refusing the sign. Let us therefore dictate that when new families arrive that wave branding, their eldest child should be taken from them and rendered to the state as its slave! The gods will be happy, for those that fail them are punished, and you will be happy, for you&apos;ll receive full free labour!</content>

These we must weed out, which we can do by setting up a body of investigators that will make certain... inquiries. The Inquisition, we would call it, there to safeguard your citizens by removing dissenters from society! By removal we mean shipped off to your factories where their arduous labour will be their penance—and your benefit!</content>

We know very well though, that this evolution came at big costs, so I&apos;ve been racking my brain, thinking of how to reduce them. Finally I have found the answer: the nationalisation of industry. All these privately run factories; all these suppliers, they are letting profits flow to their own pockets and they deliver rather shabby products as a result. Enough I say! Let the state control industry and quality will increase whereas production costs will decrease once more.</content>
