This dwarven product consists of no more than water, sugar and Element X, whatever that may be. Element X is a morally bankrupt factor in that it is, one: the reason for the dwarves to sell sugar water for preposterous prices even though it adds no taste, and two: early results indicate it may actually cause a variety of diseases. Falstaff denies this, but I believe in the data I have been given!</content>
	<content contentuid="h1ab4b756gf86cg4b53gad46ga5c5e403463a">Commander, the Seven truly are happy residents in your empire, but we could see them happier still! Indulgences make the church rich and powerful, and branding newcomers with the Sign of the Seven separates those really meant for greatness and those who aren&apos;t. Yet, don&apos;t you think the naysayers are let off a bit easily? They are sent to mine and mill to be certain, but they are not actually punished for refusing the sign. Let us therefore dictate that when new families arrive that wave branding, their eldest child should be taken from them and rendered to the state as its slave! The gods will be happy, for those that fail them are punished, and you will be happy, for you&apos;ll receive full free labour!</content>

We also believe they will fight harder for their country if pressed, for a new overlord may not hold their welfare in high regard. Clearly this will benefit you in times of need! So how can we increase the happiness of a huge part of your citizenry? By allowing them to form unions so they can stand up for themselves better. What do you say?</content>

It is in your power and your power alone, you see, to make top political appointments. Ambassadors, councillors, ministers, the lot! All may be handpicked by the emperor. Needless to say, the amount of backdealing and bribery going on behind the scenes in order to obtain these posts is staggering. Relinquish this one right, Commander! Let candidates take exams; let committees appoint them! Then, perhaps, we&apos;ll find more able people, which will—I promise you—benefit both your government and your economy.
